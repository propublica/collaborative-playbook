## About the Documenting Hate project

Documenting Hate is a collaborative, crowd-powered project launched by ProPublica in January 2017 to investigate hate crimes and bias incidents in the United States. More than 180 newsrooms are partners, as well as nearly 20 college newspapers and various journalism schools. To date, the project has collected more than 6,000 tips and journalists have produced more than 200 stories.

## About Our Collaborative Tool

We built a turnkey tool called Collaborate, which lets newsrooms set up their own crowd-powered projects. [Learn how to launch and use it](https://propublica.gitbook.io/collaborate-user-manual/).
