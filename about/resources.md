## Collaborative Reporting Tools

[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com): Many newsrooms already use Google Docs and Sheets, but not every IT department allows journalists to use their work emails on Google Drive, which requires [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/).

[Slack](https://slack.com/) : This is a useful tool for communicating quickly with partners, sharing news and uploading files.

[Trello](https://trello.com/): This helps with task and project management, and it is especially helpful if you need to collaborate reporting or distribution among teams.

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/): A sophisticated tool used for project planning and tracking. You can also use it to collect callout responses.
