### Collaborative Reporting Tools

[Slack](https://slack.com/) : This is a useful tool for communicating quickly with partners, sharing news and uploading files. 

[Trello](https://trello.com/): This helps with task and project management, and it is especially helpful if you need to collaborate reporting or distribution among teams. 

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/): A sophisticated tool used for project planning and tracking. You can also use it to collect callout responses.
